<h3>Steps</h3>
<!--Add an ordered list with the steps needed for making the dish-->
  <ol>
    <li>Turn on your grill to high to let it start heating up. Leave the lid closed after igniting. You want your grill to get up to 450 to 500 degrees farenheit.</li>
    <li>Open your 1/2 package of Costco pork loin. Costco sells the porkloin in "two-packs". In fact you are actually getting 4 loins for the price on the package.</li>
    <li>Rinse your two loins in cold water and pat completly dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Generously apply Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt to all sides of your porkloin. Don't be shy. More salt here will not make your dish taste salty</li>
    <li>Let your pork sit in salty goodness for as long as you're comfortable: up to 30 mins. (Please follow recommended guidlines for raw pork and temperature exposure)</li>
    <li>Once your pork has had enough time with the salt, crack some pepper over all sides to your taste. I like a medium amount at this point.</li>
    <li>Apply a light coating of Olive Oil to your seasoned pork loins. This will help keep the meat from sticking to your grill.</li>
    <li>Time to throw the meat on the fire. Turn you middle burners down to medium-low. You don't want the heat directly under the meat to be to hot, but you do want to keep the temperature inside the closed grill as hot as possible.</li>
    <li>Open the grill lid and add the porkloins to the middle of the grill. Close the lid and set a timer for 9 1/2 minutes</li>
    <li>After 9 1/2 minutes of grilling, open the lid and turn the porkloins over to cook the other side. You should see nice grill marks on the "cooked" side.</li>
    <li>Set another 9 1/2 minute timer and prepare your table with your sides.</li>
    <li>After the final 9 1/2 minute timer has gone off, retreive your porkloins from the grill by placing them on a baking sheet and covering the baking sheet with aluminum foil</li>
    <li>Rest. The meat that is. The longer the better, but 8 minutes is a good minimum.</li>
    <li>Serve. Cut your grilled pork loins into disks approximately 2 inches thick and plate to your serving platter</li>
    <li>Enjoy a high protein delicous weeknight meal and remember you still have another 1/2 package for next week.</li>
</ol>
