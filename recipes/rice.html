<h2>Why Perfect Rice is Easy</h2>
  <p>Rice cookers have changed perfect rice from a multi-hour affair to a 5 minute prep. It almost feels like cheating, but the best rice is made in a rice cooker.</p>
  <p>You will need high quality long grain white rice and a ricecooker. Then just wash your rice before placing into the rice cooker and all the rice-y magic happens while you accomplish your other tasks. The rice cooker can take longer to do its work than you think, so start your rice well in advance of when you need it. Lucky for you, modern rice cookers have a "keep warm" setting that will keep your rice perfect for up to 6 hours</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
   <!--Add a "Steps" heading-->
<ol>
  <li>Measure out the amount of rice you need using the included measuring cup that came with your rice cooker. We will use 3 "cups" for this recipe.</li>
  <li>Add the dry rice to your rice cookers bowl. The bowls are removable from the cooker for preparation and cleaning.</li>
  <li>Add water to your rice in the rice cooker bowl until the bowl is about half way filled</li>
  <li>Using your hand, gently move the rice around in the water to remove the extra starches from your rice. This is "washing your rice". The water should become cloudy</li>
  <li>Drain the cloudy water from the rice bowl being careful not to lose any rice kernals with the water</li>
  <li>Refill your rice bowl water as before to about half way up and repeat the washing steps using your hand and drain as before</li>
  <li>Repeat the washing steps 2 to 3 times or until water remains clear.</li>
  <li>After water has become clear and drained from bowl, use the rice cookers included measuring cup to add the same amount of "cups" of water as you did rice. We will add 3 "cups" of water for this recipe</li>
  <li>Return your rice cooker bowl to the rice cooker</li>
  <li>Set or ensure that your rice cooker is set to "White Rice"</li>
  <li>Push "Start" or "Cook" and enjoy the happy cooking music your rice cooker has prepared for you</li>
  <li>That it. Your rice cooker will sing you another song when it has finished cooking the rice. All that's left is to fluff and serve.</li>
  <li>Using the included rice paddle or a large spoon, fluff the rice by gently scooping to release any compaction that has taking place. Or, Fluff your rice.</li>
  <li>Serve onto your plates individually or transfer your rice into your serving bowl and enjoy</li>
</ol>
