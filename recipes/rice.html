<h2>Why Perfect Rice is Easy</h2>
  <p>Rice cookers have changed perfect rice from a multi-hour affair to a 5 minute prep. It almost feels like cheating, but the best rice is made in a rice cooker.</p>
  <p>You will need high quality long grain white rice and a ricecooker. Then just wash your rice before placing into the rice cooker and all the rice-y magic happens while you accomplish your other tasks. The rice cooker can take longer to do its work than you think, so start your rice well in advance of when you need it. Lucky for you, modern rice cookers have a "keep warm" setting that will keep your rice perfect for up to 6 hours</p>
